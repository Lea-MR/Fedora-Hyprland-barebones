[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red, white, yellow.

# a terminal that can change color definitions such as Gnome-terminal or rxvt.
# default is to keep current terminal color
#background = 'black'

# SDL and sdl_glsl only support hex code colors, these are the default:
background = '#111111'
foreground = '#33ffff'


# Gradient mode, only hex defined colors are supported,
# background must also be defined in hex or remain commented out. 1 = on, 0 = off.
# You can define as many as 8 different colors. They range from bottom to top of screen

[output]
# Output method. Can be 'ncurses', 'noncurses', 'raw', 'noritake', 'sdl'
# or 'sdl_glsl'.
# 'noncurses' uses a custom framebuffer technique and prints only changes
# from frame to frame in the terminal. 'ncurses' is default if supported.
#
# 'raw' is an 8 or 16 bit (configurable via the 'bit_format' option) data
# stream of the bar heights that can be used to send to other applications.
# 'raw' defaults to 200 bars, which can be adjusted in the 'bars' option above.
#
# 'noritake' outputs a bitmap in the format expected by a Noritake VFD display
#  in graphic mode. It only support the 3000 series graphical VFDs for now.
#
# 'sdl' uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer to render in a graphical context.
# 'sdl_glsl' uses SDL to create an OpenGL context. Write your own shaders or
# use one of the predefined ones.
method = ncurses


# Visual channels. Can be 'stereo' or 'mono'.
# 'stereo' mirrors both channels with low frequencies in center.
# 'mono' outputs left to right lowest to highest frequencies.
# 'mono_option' set mono to either take input from 'left', 'right' or 'average'.
# set 'reverse' to 1 to display frequencies the other way around.
orientation = bottom
channels = mono
mono_option = average
